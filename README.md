# HomeBank Archive

### Description
HomeBank Archive (`hb-archive`) is a script to create a monthly archive of backup files created by HomeBank. I've used this script with HomeBank version 5.2.3 but it should work with any version of the program that creates a daily backup with the .bak extension on Ubuntu-based Linux systems.

The script is intended to be run on the last day of the month to archive the previous month's backup files. For instance, running the script on March 31 will archive February's backup files. However, the script can be forced to run as early as the 21st of the month.

Backup (\*.bak) files in the the `$HOME/Documents/HomeBank` directory with a timestamp earlier than 12:01 AM on the first day of the current calendar month are moved to a backup folder and a compressed archive is created in the archive folder. The archive file name takes the format `YYYY-MM--backup.zip`. Once the archive file is created, the .bak files in the backup folder are deleted. If there are no available backup files in the backup folder, no archive file is created and the script exits.

The archive and backup folders will be created in `$HOME/Documents/HomeBank` if they don't already exist.

### Installation
Download [homebankarchive-master.zip](https://github.com/RickRomig/homebankarchive/archive/master.zip) and extact it. Copy the script to a folder in your PATH, `$HOME/bin` is recommended. It can be placed in `/usr/local/bin`, however, it could be run by any user on the system.

### Running the Script
Run the script from a terminal.
```
hb-archive
# OR
./hb-archive
```
The script does not require root (sudo) access. No command line arguments are necessary except to bring up the help page.
```
$ hb-archive --help
# OR
$ hb-archive -h
```
