HomeBank Archive, version 1.0.1

hb-archive is a script to create a monthly archive of backup files created by
HomeBank. I've used this script with HomeBank version 5.2.3 but it should work
with any version that creates a daily backup with the .bak extension on
Ubuntu-based Linux systems.

The script is intended to be run on the last day of the month to archive the
previous month's backup files. For instance, running the script on March 31
archives February's backup files. However, the script can be forced to run as
early as the 21st of the month.

Backup (*.bak) files in the the ~/Documents/HomeBank directory dated earlier than
12:01 AM on the first day of the current calendar month are moved to the backup
folder and a compressed archive file is created in the archive folder. Once the
archive file is created, the .bak files in the backup folder are deleted. If
there are no backup files in the backup folder, no archive file is created and
the script exits.

The archive and backup folders are created if they don't already exist.

The only command line arguments needed are --help or -h to display this help page.
All other arguments are ignored.

Please review the README.md, LICENSE, and WARRANTY in the downloaded ZIP for
information. They can also be reviewed at https://github.com/RickRomig/homebankarchive
