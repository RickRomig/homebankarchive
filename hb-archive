$SCRIPTNAME, $VERSION

$PROGNAME is a script to create a monthly archive of backup files created
by Maxime Doyen's HomeBank program. <http://homebank.free.fr>

I've used this script with HomeBank version 5.2.3  and later but it should work
with any version of HomeBank that creates a daily backup with the .bak extension
on any Linux system based on Debian or Ubuntu.

The script is intended to be run on the last day of the month to archive the
previous month's backup files. For instance, running the script on March 31
archives February's backup files. However, the script can be forced to run as
early as the 21st of the month.

Backup (*.bak) files in the ~/Documents/HomeBank directory dated prior the first
day of the current calendar month are moved into a compressed archive file for
the prior month in an archive folder. If there are no backup files in the backup
folder, no archive file is created and the script exits.

The archive subdirectory is created under ~/Documents/HomeBank if it doesn't
already exist.

The only command line arguments allowed are '--info' to display this info page
or --version to dipslay version information. Any other arguments are reported
as errors.

Please review the README.md, LICENSE, and WARRANTY in the downloaded ZIP archive
for more information. They can also be reviewed in my repository at:
